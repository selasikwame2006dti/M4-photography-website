                </div></div>
                <div class="p"><p>Dennis Prescott is one of the most famous food photographers in the industry. But he is also a chef and cookbook author.

                    He was once a struggling musician, but then he found his passion for food. His rise to success and fame was quicker than most.
                    
                    That’s because he is one of the hosts of the Netflix show Restaurants on the Edge. The hosts help struggling restaurants start over and find their path to success.
